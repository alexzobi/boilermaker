## these are the notes for my fabulous project ##

- UP API uses OAUTH 2.0 protocol
- client_id and client_secret is assigned to each application
- developer requests authorization from user to obtain access token to use on future requests.
  - each token has an expiration time (one year) and the dev can use multiple times.
